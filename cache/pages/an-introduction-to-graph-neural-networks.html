<p><em>Geometric Deep Learning</em> has seen an impressive increase in popularity over the past few years, and since pretty much everything can be modelled as a graph, I have been more and more curious about it.<br>
In this post, I will try to compress the main intuitions (at a very high level) behind <em>Graph neural networks</em>, so that it will be easier to get to more detailed aspects in the future posts.</p>

<h3 id="What-is-a-graph?">What is a graph?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-is-a-graph?">&#182;</a></h3><p>A graph is a data structure made of <em>nodes (or vertices)</em> connected by <em>edges (or links)</em>; to simplify, we can say that edges represent the relationships between nodes.<br>
Depending on the way the edges link the nodes, we can distinguish between <em>directed graphs</em> (in which direction matters and is specified at each edge) and <em>undirected graphs</em> (in which edges have no specified direction and can be traversed how we desire).</p>

<p>There are many examples of information that can be represented through graphs:</p>
<ul>
<li>chemical molecular structures or interactions between proteins (like the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ppi">PPI</a> dataset)</li>
<li>document citation networks (like the <a href="https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA">CORA</a> dataset)</li>
<li>social media networks</li>
</ul>
