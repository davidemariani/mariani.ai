<p><em>Geometric Deep Learning</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/prlz77/status/1178662575900368903">has become increasingly popular over the past few years</a>, and my curiosity about it has been growing significantly in the past few months.<br>
In this post, I will try to compress the main intuitions (at a very high level) behind <em>Graph neural networks</em>, so that it will be easier to get to more detailed aspects in the future posts.

<p><h2><strong>What is a graph?</strong></h2> <a class="anchor" id="what-is-a-graph"></a></p>
<p>A graph is a data structure made of <em>nodes (or vertices)</em> connected by <em>edges (or links)</em>; we can simply say that edges represent the relationships between nodes.<br>
Depending on the way the edges link the nodes, we can classify graphs as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph"><em>directed</em></a> (edges direction matters and is specified at each edge) and <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/~ftang/courses/CS241/notes/graph.htm"><em>undirected</em></a> (edges have no specified direction and can be traversed how we desire).</p>

<p>Connectivity is another way to do network classification: for example, a graph in which all the nodes are connected to all the others is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph"><em>complete</em></a>, while a graph without any directed cylces is categorized as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph"><em>directed acyclic</em></a>.</p>

<p>There are many different graph classifications but the important thing to bear in mind is that a graph can commonly be described by its connectivity information with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix#:~:text=In%20graph%20theory%20and%20computer,or%20not%20in%20the%20graph.&amp;text=If%20the%20graph%20is%20undirected,the%20adjacency%20matrix%20is%20symmetric."><em>adjacency matrix</em></a>, that simply stores a "1" if two nodes are connected (like node "a" and node "c" in the image below) or a "0" if they are not.

<p><h2><strong>Node, edge and graph level information</strong></h2> <a class="anchor" id="information-level"></a><br>
<img align='left' src="/images/embedding.png" alt="Drawing" width=400/></p>
<p>Each piece of the graph carries a different information level:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>node</strong>, with attributes such as number of neighbours or node class </li>
<li><strong>edge</strong>, with directions and attributes like edge weight or edge class</li>
<li><strong>graph information</strong>, with global attributes like number of nodes or shortest paths</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, each element can be seen as a place in which we can store information, creating different types of <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/embeddings/video-lecture#:~:text=An%20embedding%20is%20a%20relatively,can%20translate%20high%2Ddimensional%20vectors.&amp;text=Ideally%2C%20an%20embedding%20captures%20some,learned%20and%20reused%20across%20models.">embedding</a>.<br>
This is particularly important in the <em>deep learning</em> domain, since embeddings can be learned and treated similarly to weights to train.</p>

<p><h2><strong>Graphs applications</strong></h2> <a class="anchor" id="modelling-examples"></a></p>
<p>As stated in the magnificent article <a href="https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/#graph-to-tensor"><em>A gentle introduction to Graph Neural Networks</em></a><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> (from which I have taken most of the inspiration for this post), <em>"graphs are all around us"</em>, and the followings are just a few examples of what can be represented using them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>interactions</strong> (like <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/social-networks/">social media networks</a>, <a href="https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryNetwork.aspx?lang=en">trade networks</a> or document citation networks. The <a href="https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA">CORA</a> dataset is a good example of the latter)</li>
<li><strong>fraud detection systems</strong> (<a href="https://blog.careem.com/en/crazywall-graph-based-identity-fraud-detection/">here</a> a graph based identity fraud detection is described)</li>
<li><strong>chemical molecular structures</strong> or interactions between proteins (like the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ppi">PPI</a> dataset)</li>
<li><strong>recommender systems</strong> (here's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06339.pdf">a review of graph learning based recommender systems</a>)</li>
<li><strong>manifolds</strong> (an application of geometric deep learning on manifold is shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b0e41H4J_A">this short video</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even <strong>images</strong> and <strong>text</strong> can be represented using a graph!<br>
An image is a graph in which each node represents a pixel, and each edge shows the connection between that pixel and the adjacent ones.<br>
A node representing a non-border pixel (like the central one in the image below) always has 8 linked nodes, and the vector stored within the node has 3 dimensions representing the RGB channel.</p>

</div><p>When dealing with text, <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tokenization-1.html">tokenization</a> is one of the fundamental pre-processing steps, so that we can use characters, words and similar as separate elements of a sequence. Each of these elements can potentially be modelled as a node of a graph.</p>

<p><h2><strong>Graph Machine Learning Tasks and Challenges</strong></h2> <a class="anchor" id="GML-tasks"></a>
The types of prediction that we can do when working on a graph happen at the usual three main levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graph level</strong> predictions (where we try to predict a property of the entire graph, and the label is assigned to the entire graph itself)</li>
<li><strong>Node level</strong> predictions (where we want to predict the role or identity of a node. A typical example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary%27s_karate_club">Zachary's Karate Club</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Edge level</strong> predictions (where we make predictions on the relationships between the graph's nodes)  </li>
</ul>
<p>The first step to take when facing one of the above problems is to find the correct way to represent the data and make them understandable for the model we are using.<br>
In my experience, a traditional approach was just to use the graph modelling as a "feature extractor" for traditional machine learning models, adding predictors coming from network topology or interactions simulations to the existing ones.<br>
Anyway, to fully leverage the graph machine learning potentials, it is necessary to represent them in a way that is compatible with neural networks.<br>
Machine Learning models are typically fed with regular arrays as input, so it is not trivial to find a way to represent a graph (with all the information levels mentioned above and the consequent interactions) for them.<br>
Using the adjacency matrix for it presents few problems, which are very well explained in <a href="https://youtu.be/JtDgmmQ60x8?t=411">this video</a> from the <a href="https://antoniolonga.github.io/Pytorch_geometric_tutorials/index.html">Pytorch Geometric Tutorial project</a><a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>:</p>
