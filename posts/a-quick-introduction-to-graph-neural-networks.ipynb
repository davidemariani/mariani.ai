    "A graph is a data structure made of *nodes (or vertices)* connected by *edges (or links)*; we can simply say that edges represent the relationships between nodes.  \n",
    "Depending on the way the edges link the nodes, we can classify graphs as [*directed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) (edges direction matters and is specified at each edge) and [*undirected*](https://www.cpp.edu/~ftang/courses/CS241/notes/graph.htm) (edges have no specified direction and can be traversed how we desire). \n",
    "Connectivity is another way to do network classification: for example, a graph in which all the nodes are connected to all the others is called [*complete*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph), while a graph without any directed cylces is categorized as [*directed acyclic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph). \n",

    "There are many different graph classifications but the important thing to bear in mind is that a graph can commonly be described by its connectivity information with an [*adjacency matrix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix#:~:text=In%20graph%20theory%20and%20computer,or%20not%20in%20the%20graph.&text=If%20the%20graph%20is%20undirected,the%20adjacency%20matrix%20is%20symmetric.), that simply stores a \"1\" if two nodes are connected (like node \"a\" and node \"c\" in the image below) or a \"0\" if they are not. \n",
