    "A graph is a data structure made of *nodes (or vertices)* connected by *edges (or links)*; to simplify, we can say that edges represent the relationships between nodes.  \n",
    "Depending on the way the edges link the nodes, we can distinguish between *directed graphs* (in which direction matters and is specified at each edge) and *undirected graphs* (in which edges have no specified direction and can be traversed how we desire).\n",
